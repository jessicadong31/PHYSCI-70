  <h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    
      <p> Sound-Reactive LED Lights! </p>

<p>Concept: </p>
<p>My idea for a final project is creating my own sound-reactive LED light system. This would be a fun decorative/interactive addition to any room. The core feature is that a sound sensor will recognize the beats in the music that you play on an external speaker and change the colors of the lights to match the beat. Some kind of control system will allow you to customize the colors to your preference so that you’d be able to change the color scheme to match the mood of the music you’re listening to. This sound-sensitive light system could be synchronized with an LED text display to match the color-changing scheme and display lyrics of songs in real-time. This would probably work by reading text files of pre-selected songs. Controlling the lights through your phone could be an additional feature of the project depending on how feasible that is.</p>

<p>Skills:</p>
<p>3D design and fabrication (either mold/cast, 3D print, lasercut, etc.)</p>
<p>The LED text display will probably require some kind of 3D fabrication, although at this stage I’m not completely sure how this could be accomplished.</p>

<p>Electronics (input and output):</p>
<p>To detect sound, this light system will need to include some kind of sensor that takes external sounds as an input and can communicate with the microcontroller.</p>

<p>Microcontroller programming:</p>
<p>Arduinos could be used to program the sound sensitivity, the color changes, and the lyric text display.</p>
